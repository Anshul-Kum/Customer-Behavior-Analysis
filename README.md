# Customer-Behavior-Analysis
## Background
Customers are one of the most valuable assets for a company's success, but it is not feasible to manage all customers in the same way. Effective customer targeting requires segmenting them to build meaningful relationships that surpass their expectations. Since no market offering can cater to every market or individual, segmentation becomes a vital tool in marketing strategies.
## Task
To do RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and segment the customers based on RFM values using a clustering algorithm.
## Dataset
